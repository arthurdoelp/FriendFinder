# FriendFinder

# Overview

For this app, the goal is to fill out a survey that will match you with a series of people objects in a JSON array who is most compatible given your responses.  This app is an example of combining both a server side functionality with front-end client side functionality with the survey inputs.  I use a node.js server to control the responses and requests between the inputs from the survey and doing the backend logic to calculate the best match with the JSON Array. I divided up the routing into a file for API communication and html routing. These controlled the directing to different pages and the adding and updating to the server.  the server.js controls the initialization of the server and setting it to listen on PORT 8080.  The goal of this was to combine my knowledge of both the front and back-end by creating efficient communication with the server and the client.  I believe I was able to do this.  I think there are a few bugs, but it achieves it MVP functionality.

An important point of this app is when matching with a "friend" instead of matching with a person you are matching with a particular varietal of wine that best matches your survey inputs! (My favorite theme)
